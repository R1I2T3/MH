# Architecture Overview

## System Components

### Frontend (Next.js)
- React components for user interface
- Real-time data updates
- Responsive design
- Client-side caching

### Backend (Next.js API Routes)
- API endpoints for query processing
- User management
- Rate limiting
- Database interactions

### NLP Service (Python/FastAPI)
- Natural language processing
- Financial data integration
- Sentiment analysis
- News aggregation

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- User data
- Query history
- Company information
- Caching layer

## Data Flow
1. User submits query through frontend
2. Query is processed by backend API
3. NLP service analyzes query and fetches data
4. Results are stored and returned to user

## Security Considerations
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- API key
